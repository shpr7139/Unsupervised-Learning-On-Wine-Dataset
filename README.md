# Unsupervised Learning on Wine Dataset

## Project Overview
This project explores the **Wine Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using **unsupervised learning techniques**.  
The goal is to uncover natural groupings in wine samples based on their chemical composition, without using labels during training.  

We apply **clustering algorithms** (KMeans, Agglomerative, Gaussian Mixture Models) and **dimensionality reduction** (PCA) to analyze the dataset, evaluate model performance, and interpret results.
